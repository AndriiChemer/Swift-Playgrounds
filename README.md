# Swift Playgrounds

Some experiments with Playgrounds in XCode 6 using the Swift programming language.

- **ASwiftTour.playground** contains the code from the "Swift Tour" chapter of the book Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. https://itunes.apple.com/au/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11. This file has the most meat so far. It touches on most of the unusual features of the language and is easy to search through to find examples.

Chapters from the Language guide. Each chapter goes into depth about its particular subject.
