Some experiments with Playgrounds in XCode 6 using the Swift programming language.

- **ASwiftTour.playground** contains the code from the "Swift Tour" chapter of the book Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. https://itunes.apple.com/au/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11. This file has the most meat so far. It touches on most of the unusual features of the language and is easy to search through to find examples.
