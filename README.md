# Swift Playgrounds

Some experiments with Playgrounds in XCode 6 using the Swift programming language.

I have been working through all the examples in the book Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. https://itunes.apple.com/au/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11. Each .playground file in the project relates to a chapter from the Swift Programming Language book.

- **ASwiftTour.playground** contains the code from the "Swift Tour" chapter. This file has the most meat so far. It touches on most of the unusual features of the language and is easy to search through to find examples.

Chapters from the Language guide. Each chapter goes into depth about its particular subject.

- **TheBasics.playground** This chapter covers basic value types like Strings, Ints, Bools and floats. The notation for exponent values in float literals is interesting. Comments are covered (nested /* */ comment blocks). TypeAlias is covered as are tuples. Optionals are touched on and assertions are mentioned.
- **BasicOperators.playground** Arithmetic, remainder, increment, decrement, comparison, unary, ternary, range (closed and half-closed) and logical operators. There are examples of all of them.
- **StringsAndCharacters.playground** Some details about Unicode literals (multi-byte characters). The countElements() function for finding the length of a string. Concatenating strings, Comparing strings and Interpolating strings (not much on splitting or parsing strings).
